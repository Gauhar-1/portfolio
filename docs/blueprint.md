## Style Guidelines:

- Dark color scheme, creating a professional and modern feel. Background: Dark blue (#121212).
- Primary color: A calming teal (#26A69A) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Accent color: A muted gold (#A98D63) to complement the primary and add a touch of sophistication.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look. Its neutral style lends well to code display, making an additional font unnecessary.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for skills and technologies. Icons should be consistent in style and size.
- Single-page layout with smooth scrolling to each section. Grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment.
- Subtle animations on scroll and hover to enhance user experience. Use smooth transitions and micro-interactions.
